title: UPDATE: Launching a Successful Kickstarter Campaign
---

**Initial Modeling Success**

In a previous post, I reported the success I had building an algorithm that predicted the probability of success on Kickstarter. I was able to build at model that had 68 percent accuracy on our test set. I also attempted to successfully predict the probality of success with two live Kickstarter campaigns: *[Love Found]*(https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/makehistory/lovefound-by-jon-rua) and *[Renegade Repos]*(https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1707992326/renegade-repos-web-show?ref=nav_search).

Both campaigns ended, and our algorithm succeeded in predicting the outcome of both. We gave *Love Found* an 85 percent probability of success, and it indeed succeeded. In fact, *Love Found* exceeded its fundraising goal of $3,000 and raised $13,225. This author theorizes that the key to its success was that it was a dance campaign of short duration that set a low goal.

As predicted, *Renegade Repo* did no succeed. It raised only $475.00. The biggest problem with this web series is that it was a video project of longer duration seeking too much money. Film & video projects are more likely to be unsuccessful, and it did not help that the campaign was over 40 days in duration.
