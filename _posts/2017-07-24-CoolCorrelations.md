**Cool Correlations Explained**

Correlations reveal relationships between variables and are often described as a single number “r” falling between -1 and 1. A negative correlation describes an inverse relationship, and a positive correlation describes a direct relationship.An r = 1 or  -1 represents the strongest possible correlation, while an r = 0 is the weakest.

Correlations can therefore provide great insights into data, as well as spurious connections.

Consider the wonderful world of cheese.

There is a correlation between per capita consumption of mozzarella cheese, and the number of doctorates awarded in civil engineering (r =  0.96). Even stranger is the correlation between per capita cheese consumption, and [death](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) by bed sheet entanglement.  

One might assume that cheese has amazing causal powers, including the power to kill and the power to educate. This is a dangerouse mistake. First, a correlation does not prove causation.  Eating a cheese pizza will neither result in a Ph.D., nor send your linens into a [murderous rage.](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)  Second, the relationships between cheese, engineers and death are likely spurious. The connection may very well be by chance, though one can ask whether cheese and doctorates may be sensitive to an underlying trend. Have an idea, please reach out.
